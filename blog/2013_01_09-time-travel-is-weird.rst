    "Time travel is weird"
    - *Samantha Warring*

Nonsense right? Time travel doesn't exist, and if it gets invented at
any point in the future, we'd concievably know about it now.

"No I mean moving *forward*, we do it all day, every day"

Well that's an interesting way to think about life, we're never still
in the physical world. Always rotating on a rock, flying through space, 
traversing ever forward in the limitless dimension of time. 

Time is the final dimension because after a moment has passed, that same moment will
never be repeated and can never be returned to. Any concept or memory of the past
is a chemical reaction occuring NOW. Although one can easily return to a physical place
(in locality or in the universe, which technically just has a different
reference point), we are cooerced to travel monotonically through time.

The conclusion that I naturally draw is that there is no past, in fact there is
no future either. Our time traveling nature permits us one temporal thing
in our lives: this present moment. My fingers pressing the keys as I write
this post, THIS happens now, nothing else.
