    <img class="float-left" src="http://masenf.com/img/blog/noise.png" alt="" />Over to
    the left of the restaurant, a small group of college students are conversing with
    each other. Judging by their body language, it's fairly clear that only one of them
    knows everyone else at the table. Maybe the others know a few names.<br />
    <br />
    I can feel the tension, the emotional guards, and the nervousness: "I'm in a group of
    people, what should <b>I</b> <i>say</i> next?". The control in these situations is
    often primal and rooted in the ego. The group dynamic is such that low-quality
    statements are made for the sake of filling the void. Perhaps I feel like what I have
    to say is of value, but unfortunately it's likely not. How could I positively
    contribute to a conversation that I'm only half listening to? Extrapolate this
    'anti-social' behavior across the group and the end result is cheap 'small-talk' or
    worse, bro speak. Nothing is real.<br />
    <br />
    Why do we behave in such ways. Those of us who practice&nbsp;<a href=
    "http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm" rel="nofollow" target=
    "_blank">Active Listening</a> will know that it requires much more effort than trying
    to garner group attention by blurting whatever your brain thinks is the coolest thing
    at the time. Listening is a major factor to advancing the conversation and keeping it
    interesting. Listening is the <i>only</i> way to have real interactions.<br />
    <br />
    So where am I going with this? A common group meme which I observe is something I'll
    refer to as "the void-filling adjunctive". In this case I'm referring to the
    <i>void</i> in conversation which occurs when the group is processing what was just
    stated and reading the body language of the room. The purpose of the void-filling
    adjunctive is to connect disjoint parts of the conversation or to prevent any sort of
    thought between statements when no one can think of the next thing to say.. I find
    it's commonly expressed after about 15 seconds of silence as "AWkward!", or "Awkward
    silence", or *looks around room* *begins laughing".&nbsp; There are others, anything
    which fits this purpose works.<br />
    <br />
    Is there something wrong with this though? Yes.<br />
    <ol>
      <li>It breaks the flow of thought
      </li>
      <li>It's artificial and adds nothing to the conversation
      </li>
      <li>It's an obnoxious and dirty habit<br />
      </li>
    </ol>There can be cases where a void-filling adjunctive can be hilarious or has some
    other value to add as a rhetorical tool. Primarily it introduces <b>noise</b> into
    our lives. It's a very subtle observation, but it leads to the revelation of
    something much greater: <i>"we" fill our lives with noise subconsciously and
    purposefully because we don't want to think.</i><br />
    <br />
    The key is that it's subconscious. Asking people on the street whether they like to
    think or appreciate noise in their life will not yield this conclusion. However,
    actions speak louder than words, and in our actions we see the intent of the
    subconscious revealed plainly.<br />
    <br />
    Look around America: it is culturally valued to surround yourself with entertainment,
    from smartphones to tablets, television, iPods, cars, or shiny things. Whatever is
    your noise of choice, it remains that it is still noise. It's not <i>real</i>. And
    it's getting louder every year. Culturally displacing thought and awareness for
    external stimuli degrades the quality of our existence, our connection with each
    other, and most importantly, our connection with our essence.<br />
    <br />
    An important realization that I'm making in my journey is that it's difficult and
    worthwhile to increase the signal to noise ratio in my life. Reducing the noise
    increases awareness, and awareness increases balance.<br />
    <br />
    When I'm so distracted by all the noise, when I give my attention, my focus, and my
    <a href="https://to/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fucks</a> to the noise, it's
    hard to remain fixed on the bigger picture of what matters in life:
    <b>Nothing</b>.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
