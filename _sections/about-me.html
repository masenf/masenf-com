<p>Life is meant to be lived! And it's so much sweeter sharing it with someone
who reminds you of that. The ups and the downs are par for the course, but at the
end of the day, <strong>love is what truly matters</strong>. Strip everything away, but our love
we'll always have.</p>

<p>Professionally, I'm a <strong>principal software engineer</strong> working in validation
  for Isilon Systems, a subdivision of Dell Technologies. I work with a great team, focused on
  ensuring our end users have the best possible experience using our product to run
  their mission-critical operations. Our customers are some of the biggest names in
  media and entertainment, finance, manufacturing, security, and government. And the
  work I do every day ensures that they can continue to change the world.</p>

<p>In 2018, my lovely wife and best friend, Samantha, made me a father! It's a radical
  change from the freewheeling adventurous rambling lives we lived so recently. But,
  it's an experience unlike anything I've found out there in the world. Even though
  this is the about me section, I'm starting to learn that it's not about me
  anymore. Every decision that I make now affects my son, and I need to consider him
  in everything I do. But the payoff is endless love and lessons, and ultimately
  making me a stronger, better person than I ever imagined. Student and Teacher,
  our roles switch by the moment. It reminds me that there's always more to learn.</p>

<p>I find my artistic outlet in the form of music. While I've been playing guitar
  since 2003, I'm only just beginning to find myself as a musician. When I'm composing,
  I feel free. I hear the ideas in my head and in my heart, and it's inspired me to
  invest the time to better learn the tools to take those ideas and feelings and render
  them into physical existence. Practice is the only way to improve. And 2017 showed me
  that years mean nothing -- it's about challenging oneself and deliberately
  choosing to grow.</p>
