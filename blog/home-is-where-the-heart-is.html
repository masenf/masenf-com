    <img class="float-left" src="http://masenf.com/img/blog/family1.jpg" alt="" width=
    "240" />I ventured 'home' this weekend to Longview, WA to visit my lovely mom for
    mother's day and spend some time with family. It's been a great weekend (it usually
    is when I avoid the L-town bar scene) and I couldn't have asked for better
    interactions with those who I love.<br />
    <br />
    That said, it's been strange---ever since I moved out in 2009---to realize that
    <b>life</b> happens here even when I'm not around. People change and grow, and as
    much as it feels like it, life doesn't stop when I'm not around. I come by every
    month or so and for the most part, it feels like a continuous experience. It
    <i>feels</i> like I never left, but the town is different. My friends are gone.<br />
    <br />
    I saw my cousin last night. I see him every time I'm in town, so naturally I assumed
    he's over here at my parent's house all the time. He hasn't been over since the last
    time I was in town. It sinks in...<br />
