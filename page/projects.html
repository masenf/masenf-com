            <p>This is a project to bring a fully featured computer algebra
            system with graphing capability to android phones and tablets. I'm
            working on this project with Nam Ngo. Currently in its early stages,
            we aim to have a presentation and public demo available by May
            2012.</p>

            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/symja/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">symja</a>, 
            which already has an 'expression evaluator' for Android devices.
            What we seek to replicate is the sort of all-in-one educational
            ubiquity enjoyed by the likes of TI</p>

            <h3>FreeBSD Oracle Compatibility</h3>
            <img class="float-right" src="/img/freebsd_daemon.jpg" alt="FreeBSD
            Demon" height="58" width="55" />

            <p>Since the release of FreeBSD 9.0, the standard FreeBSD compiler
            no longer supports linking to Linux libraries via use of the
            Linuxulator. Previously we had made use of the built in linux binary
            compatibility in order to build and run cx_Oracle on our FreeBSD
            servers to talk to the campus database.</p>

            <p>I've tried a few different solutions and have found one which
            works, but is definitely not clean. So the options are: continue
            with the unclean solution, and be able upgrade to 9.1 (and begin
            using amd64 kernel). Or stick with 8.2 until someone fixes linux
            library linking support. I definitely don't have the time or
            technical knowledge to contribute the fix personally. In fact I
            barely have the time to write up my workaround, though I hope to do
            so by April 2013, stay tuned</p>

            <h3>Redundant DHCP</h3>
            <img class="float-right" src="/img/dhcp_square.png" alt="">
            <p>My next project at work is implementing redundant DHCP servers.
            Since I started working for University Residences in 2009, this has
            been a TODO list item. Now that we've got brand new servers to take
            care of web proxy. Our older servers can be made to do not just
            failover, but load balanced DHCP. I'll be using isc-dhcp41-server
            v4.1-ESV-R4 which includes plenty of new features for making peer'd
            DHCP less of a nightmare.</p>

            <h3>Deploy PostgreSQL Database Server</h3>
            <p>This summer ResTek will be transitioning from a MySQL instance
            running in a VMWare ESX cluster to a brand-new
            <a href="http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/14212_div/14212_div.HTML"
            rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HP Proliant DL380p Gen8</a>
            sporting 16GB of RAM, 2x72GB 15K disks + 6x300GB 10K disks, and
            Quad-core Xeon E5-2609 processor. We'll be running FreeBSD 9.0 with
            dedicated (UFS) slices for OS, postgres data, wal archives, indexes,
            and mysql data.</p>
            
            <p>As of August 2012, the new Database server is online and keeping
            data. A successful transition for all apps will be made throughout
            the academic year 2012-2013</p>

            <p>I began working on my finite automata editor after my first week
            of CSCI 401 - Formal Languages and Automata. I found the subject to
            be initially interesting and modeling to be extremely helpful in
            understanding what was going on. My inspiration for using
            HTML5/Javascript was to enable maximum portability. The end goal is
            to support Desktop, Android, and iOS platforms.</p>

            <p>The editor allows on the fly creation of deterministic and
            non-deterministic finite automata. After building test strings can
            be executed against the machine to test for acceptance or rejection.
            While still a work in progress, eventually users will be able to
            save machines as JSON or PNG and convert machines to regular
            expressions and vice versa. Any feature suggestions are welcome.
            Once I finish the 0.1 release, I will host a live demo of the app on
            this site.</p>

            <p>I've become recently interested in externally induced visual
            field distortion. I've dug up some old code called Hallusinaattori
            which creates many moving concentric circles on the screen. Extended
            viewing of these images will trick the brain into compensating for
            the rapidly moving shapes. Looking away from the image leaves the
            compensation in place, causing a change in your visual field</p>

            <p>I'll be porting the original code from C to HTML5/JS so you'll be
            able to experience the effects first hand in your browser! An
            initial version is available at the demo link above. Click for
            customization options. Send any suggestions or patches via

            <h3>WTA Next Bus
                <a href="http://github.com/masenf/wta-next-bus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                    <span class="pointer label label-info">github</span>
                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>WTA Next Bus is an android application (or rather a framework) to
            simply display bus arrival times at a selected bus stop. I was
            inspired to write it after attempting to use Bellingham WTA's online
            service for displaying bus times -- it's virtually unusable on a phone
            and not very friendly. Currently the app displays a list of
            available bus stops (sorted by category or location) and provides a
            search and favorites feature. Other than that it shows the next 5
            busses arriving at a selected stop.</p>

            <p>The software has been written generally such that it could be
            easily adapted to service any bus line. Right now I run a python
            server which proxies requests from the app to the actual web service
            run by WTA. Because of this decoupling, the python app could serve
            static data or source its data from anywhere else. Eventually I'd
            like to add mapping support and better internal application
            caching.</p>

            <p>When I feel the application is a little more stable, I'll release
            an alpha APK here for testing. Otherwise, the code is available on
            github and builds just fine for API level &gt; 11</p>

            <h3>PyMP <span class="label">coming soon</span></h3>
            <p>PyMP is an online music player which streams your own music
            library over LAN or WAN direct to browsers and mobile devices. The
            project began in CSCI 330 Databases (Fall '11) with Python, JQuery,
            and PostgreSQL, and has since been tabled for the past year.</p>

            <p>In my 'free time' this year I plan to polish it, move to
            bootstrap/backbone on the client, rewrite the server in C, and
            release it to the public. We'll see if I can make it happen, watch
            on github or if you're feeling ambitious, help me out! I'm still
            looking for a new name as well.</p>
