    <img alt="I dont always test my code but when I do its on the production server" src=
    "/img/blog/i_dont_always_test.jpg" width="180" class="float-right" />As the
    natural-born overachieving perfection-seeking pragmatist&nbsp;that I am, I often find
    myself exceeding the specifications on my Computer Science assignments. Generally, I
    find them to be either too simple, or not interesting; and in an effort to 'get the
    education my parents paid for' I make my own rules.<br />
    <br />
    Unfortunately, in UNIX software development, part of the specification is
    to&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;NOT stray from the specification...and the assignments are
    too easy. How could I remain an overachieving bastard while not sacrificing my
    turn-in grades by modifying the assignment?<br />
    <br />
    100% code coverage? That may just be crazy enough to enlighten me. I've been
    reading/hearing about&nbsp;TDD (test driven development) and the benefits of testing
    discrete pieces of code for expected behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fun and since I
    started, I've caught about 3 or 4 bugs which previously slipped through my
    professor's grading script.&nbsp;There's plenty of material on it around the
    internet, and that's not what this entry is quite about.<br />
    <br />
    The ongoing assignment for the quarter is to implement our own basic mini shell,
    msh.&nbsp;Part of the current assignment this week is to implement shell scripting.
    Ahh, I can't wait to test this, I thought...<br />
    <br />
    The mini shell is written in C, however I'm using Python's subprocess and unittest
    modules for running 'External' tests: I&nbsp;Popen my shell and send data to it. For
    the scripting test, I open a file, __test_script.msh; write the contents of the test
    script (stored as&nbsp;literal strings in the python code); and then execute the
    shell with __test_script.msh as the argument. Straightforward right:<br />
    <br />
    <div>
      <pre>
class TestMshExternal(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.EXE = ["./msh"]
    def executeLine(self,inp,env,EXE=None):
        if EXE is None:
            EXE = self.EXE
        msh = Popen(EXE,stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, env=env)
        raw_output, raw_err = msh.communicate(inp)
        return (raw_output, raw_err, msh.returncode)
    def test_a4_execute_script(self):
        f = open("__test_script.msh","w")
        f.write("""
               echo showshift is named $0
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
               echo Argument 2 is $2.
               echo Argument 3 is $3.
               echo Argument 4 is $4.
               shift 3
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
               echo Argument 2 is $2.
               echo Argument 3 is $3.
               echo Argument 4 is $4.
               unshift 1
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.                                                                                                                                                
               unshift
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
        """)

        args1 = ["./msh","__test_script.msh","a","b"]
        result = self.executeLine("", None, args1)

        # make assertions about the result 
</pre>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br />
      So I run it and...no output. The result tuple, which should return the strings from
      the stdout and stderr buffers as well as the return code, contained empty strings.
      I looked at the script file:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
furerm@CF416-11:~/code/csci352/work/msh$ cat __test_script.msh 

               echo showshift is named $0
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
               echo Argument 2 is $2.
               echo Argument 3 is $3.
               echo Argument 4 is $4.
               shift 3
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
               echo Argument 2 is $2.
               echo Argument 3 is $3.
               echo Argument 4 is $4.
               unshift 1
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
               unshift
               echo Number of arguments is $#.
               echo Argument 1 is $1.
</pre>Everything looks good... I separated out the Popen code from the main test script
and ran it in iPython: the result came back just as expected! I tried it again as part of
the test script: Nothing. I run it from the shell, works as expected. At this point, I've
brought in some&nbsp;cronies&nbsp;to help me debug this overachieving mess to no avail.
Searching on the internet turns up nothing and my pragmatic side starts to take over:
"Dude, you've been working on this unnecessary thing (which technically works) for over
2.5 hours now, it's not worth your time!" You're right, self, so I tabled the script and
finished the actual assignment.<br />
      <br />
      After completion, I was still unsettled that my test script was borked. Determined
      to solve the problem for my own sanity, I decided to start dismantling this part of
      the test case piece by piece. (My previous solution strategy was to make a
      conjecture, try it, repeat). I moved all the shell spawning Popen stuff into the
      test function itself to isolate it and began simplifying the script. The next thing
      I removed was the actual writing of the __test_script.msh file (it already existed
      on the filesystem anyway). As I selected the last line in Vim Visual Line mode I
      had the realization of my ignorance...<br />
      <br />
      <h3>
        I never closed the file 0.o
      </h3>
    </div><br />
    The script&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;stops execution on EOF...and it never found one. All
    in all, I had sunk about 4 or 5 hours into such folly which needs only a two line
    fix. (I likely made this error because of my overuse of contextmanagers =])<br />
    <br />

    I feel like I speak out about this sort of ignorant debugging&nbsp;frequently in the
    form of advice: "Read what the code is doing, not what it *should* be doing". In all
    the tinkering, I had erroneously <b>assumed</b> that years of programming
    experiencing would compel someone to close an open file after writing it, or at least
    before executing it with an external child process...eeps.<br />
    <br />
    Just when you <i>think</i> you <i>know</i> how to program, you don't... It's as true
    in programming as it is in life: when you assume, you make an <b>ass</b>-(out
    of)-<b>u</b>-(and)-<b>me</b>.
