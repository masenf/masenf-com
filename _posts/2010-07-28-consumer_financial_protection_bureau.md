Our congress just passed the Financial Reform Bill on July 15th,
establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. What\'s
interesting to note however is in the following paragraph:

> Independent Bureau Is Established. The Financial Reform Act creates
> the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, *an independent bureau
> within* **the Federal Reserve System**. Under the direction of a
> presidential appointee, the Bureau implements federal consumer
> financial laws through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance
> and enforcement actions. Although it resides within the Federal
> Reserve System, the Bureau is autonomous: the Federal Reserve
> System\'s Board of Governors has no authority to review, approve,
> delay or prevent the issuance of any of the Bureau\'s rules or orders.

Why is this a part of the Federal Reserve? So the Fed can make sure that
the bureau won\'t be able to interfere with the prevention of consumer
fraud in the future?
