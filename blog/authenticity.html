        <b>Society</b> - A set of social norms, behaviors, beliefs, and culture held in
        common by individuals. From the enlightenment idea of the Social Contract, it is
        assumed that with society comes mutual benefit, protection, and safety.
        Civilization vs. savagery, justice vs. power. It's a great promise and an
        evolutionary step in the human experience to organize ourselves in and subscribe
        to these auspicious thought structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core, the social contract is nothing but <i>an agreement on arbitrary
        conventions</i>. All of our ills, known and unknown have been created -- they are
        not a consequence of capitolism, government policy, or the welfare state. In
        fact, these things are a consequence of our arbitrary decisions. Our undying
        faith in society has created problems for us which do not necessarily exist; it's
        our faith which has convinced the members of society that things can't change,
        that they wont. Our <b>minds</b> cling to the thought structures, our <b>fear</b>
        prevents them from changing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what happens when we don't explicity agree to the conventions, but are
        born-in to the madness that persists? What happens when the ideas of corporate
        leaders and bankers become core tenants of our supposed faith?
      </p>
      <p>
        Look around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We get money</b> -- created on fancy paper with the faith that it can be
        exchanged for goods and services, but controlled by powerful bankers, withheld
        from our fellow human beings, and used as the justification for theft, deceit,
        inequality, and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We get jobs</b> -- glorious time-sucking toils where we spend most of our
        lives doing things we admittedly do not want to do in order to "get by" in this
        world that we've created. Our lives consumed by the fear of losing our despised
        livelihood, which is the extrapolation of the fear of not getting what we want.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We get growth</b> -- preferably unchecked and exponentially increasing, to
        reduce our planet to a hot ball of carbon exhaust, and make very few people very
        very rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously the huddled masses have spoken, and yielded their lives and happiness
        in exchange for someone's steamboat fairy tale of the American Dream. But there's
        more to life. Much more in fact. It's always been there and it doesn't cost any
        money (we made that up, remember); beneath the arbitary social conventions and
        mental structures that we've built up to filter the world into good and bad,
        there exists a subtle feeling, a connection, a true unbiased perception of the
        world. <i>Beneath it all is where <b>Authenticity</b> lays.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Authenticity is always there, one can't go out and simply find authenticity and
        then stop. It's a matter of noticing it within yourself, others, and in
        interactions. The first step is to strip away everything that doesn't matter
        (thoughts, emotions, impulses) and become aware of what is left. Those thoughts,
        those emotions, much like society are not 'real'. Our minds have created them,
        for better or worse. When they are purged from your conscious flow, what is left
        is Authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        When members of society can disidentify with their faith in arbitrary
        conventions, fear will subside. When those individuals realize that we created
        money and regardless of how much any one person has, they are still the SAME,
        that society will be markedly Authentic.

        It doesn't start with society; it starts with you and me. If we want it, we need
        to make it happen.
