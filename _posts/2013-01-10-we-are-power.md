The biggest failing of modern society is the collective unconscious
understanding that we are **powerless**, unable to affect change, and
improve our situations. It\'s easier to just get a job, take care of
your self and your own, and keep quiet about the things which ail the
world.

The society that we\'ve created, this consumerist, capitalist, and
overly stimulated society thrives on the assumption that the masses are
weak. The masses are malleable, you can model the public reaction based
on mathematical equations and predictions. The people are on autopilot.
The system ensures this \-\-- *no necessitates it* \-\-- to persist at
its current level of infiltration into our lives. We yearn to be free.

Which brings me to my second point\...

**WE make the world we live in.**

And everything is arbitrary. The way things are is the way things are
because *people want them that way*. **YOU** can make it different; make
it any other way. The first step is to end *fear* and accept who you are
and the power that you truly have. Rise up and bring with you who can.
**We\'re all in this together.**
