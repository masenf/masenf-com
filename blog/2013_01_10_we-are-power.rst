The biggest failing of modern society is the collective unconscious understanding 
that we are **powerless**, unable to affect change, and improve our situations. It's
easier to just get a job, take care of your self and your own, and keep quiet 
about the things which ail the world.

The society that we've created, this consumerist, capitalist, 
and overly stimulated society thrives on the assumption that the masses are 
weak. The masses are malleable, you can model the public reaction based on 
mathematical equations and predictions. The people are 
on autopilot. The system ensures this --- *no necessitates it* --- to persist at its 
current level of infiltration into our lives. We yearn to be free.

Which brings me to my second point...

**WE make the world we live in.**

And everything is arbitrary. The way things are is the way things are because 
*people want them that way*. **YOU** can make it different; make it any other way. The
first step is to end *fear* and accept who you are and the power that you truly
have. Rise up and bring with you who can. **We're all in this together.**
