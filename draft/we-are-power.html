The biggest failing of modern society is the collective conscious understanding that we are powerless, unable to affect change, and improve our situations. It's easier to just get a job, take care of your self and your own, and keep quiet about the things which ail the world.<br><br>The society that we've created, this consumerist,&nbsp;capitalist, and overly stimulated society thrives on the assumption that the masses are weak. The masses are malleable, you can model the public reaction based on mathematical equations and predictions. The people are on autopilot, the system ensures this; no necessitates it, to persist at this level of infiltration into our lives. We yearn to be free.&nbsp;
