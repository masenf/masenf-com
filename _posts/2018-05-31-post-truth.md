it's rare to see a government exercise a great deal of transparency in its
operation. but what we're seeing in 2018 in America is undeniably a new era
in public dishonesty. the highest levels of leadership in this country are
openly spreading rumors and falsehoods for political gain.

it is acceptable to deny scientific research and competent investigation using
the very principals on which the scientific method is based: objectivity.
sowing distrust in the process by convincing the voting and non-thinking public
that unless something can be completely proven, then the leading hypothesis
cannot be trusted at all. obviously climate science denial is nothing new, but
it feels different in 2018. it feels like politicians and corporations are
winning the information war. it feels like propagandists and authoritarians
are winning the information war. too many people have given up on trust in
scientific consensus and now vote based on feelings and manipulation.

it's a dangerous road for a democracy. it erodes our freedom because the
public lacks an anchor point for trusting authority, so anyone can be an
authority. if we can't trust what our government is saying because it is
obviously fabricated, then it becomes hard to trust any authority, even
the trustworthy ones. when the public is led to distrust actual scientific
consensus, then it becomes possible to politically motivate the population
with outright lies. and once people believe the lies, it's the beginning of
the end.

i want to believe that the internet will be the tool to liberate information
and let the truth rise to the surface. but as we've seen with the 2016
presidential election and the rise of ludicrous conspiracy theories, the
internet is just as much a tool for mass deceit and propaganda. people need
to re-learn critical thinking and analysis. we need stronger institutions
that can be trusted.

thinking beyond politics, it is imperative to come to the middle, where
actual truth lives. political motivation on both extremes is too strong
to want to solve this problem as it benefits both sides (although it seems
the right most-recently).
