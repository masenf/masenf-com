Last year at 28C3_, Cory Doctorow delivered a powerful keynote talk 
about his vision of controls in the general purpose PC market. It's a
semi-apocalyptic state of affairs when you realize that he's right. There
is profit (and other) incentives to *limit* what you can do with
your computation devices. 

I'd say this video was the highlight of 28C3. In the wake of all the 29C3 
that will be coming out, I couldn't let this gem go unnoticed. Well worth
watching (or rewatching).
