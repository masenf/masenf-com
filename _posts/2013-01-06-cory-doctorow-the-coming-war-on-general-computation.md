Last year at
[28C3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/wiki/Documentation), Cory
Doctorow delivered a powerful keynote talk about his vision of controls
in the general purpose PC market. It\'s a semi-apocalyptic state of
affairs when you realize that he\'s right. There is profit (and other)
incentives to *limit* what you can do with your computation devices.

I\'d say this video was the highlight of 28C3. In the wake of all the
29C3 that will be coming out, I couldn\'t let this gem go unnoticed.
Well worth watching (or rewatching).
