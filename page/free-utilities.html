<h3>March 2013</h3>

<p>I realized that this page still exists yesterday, and was promoting some seriously questionable
software. Needless to say, over the past four years my needs and expectations for software 
have changed wildly, and thus the recommendations on this page are no longer relevant. Unfortunately,
these softwares that I used to tout are vicious and tricky in that they attempt to solicit the 
user to share more information than needed or continue with an action that may be against the
user's interest.

<p>I'm in the process of updating this page to my latest recs, so for now I'll just take the
bad links out and call it good enough. I'll update the descriptions of my previous recommendations
to make it fairly clear why they are no longer recommended

<ul>
<li><b>Antivirus</b>
    As a rule, I no longer run anti-virus software on my computers because I
    find it intrusive to privacy and a <a
    href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparativesreviews/performance-tests">detriment
    to performance</a>.  If you're savvy enough to keep your OS, browser, and
    plugins updated and avoid sketchy sites, AV software doesn't really buy you
    much. <b>AV or other 'security' software does not make you safe</b>, only
    safer. There is no substitute for familiarity, caution, and common sense.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current Recommendation:</b> <a
        href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>.
        However, there are a plethora of novice users, using Microsoft Windows
        who probably need something, and this is not bad for free security
        software. It scores in the top performance category among other
        AV software. Plus, you already trust Microsoft to produce a secure OS,
        so you're not extending your trust to another third party by using this
        tool.</li>
        
        <li>AVG Anti-virus Free Edition: I used to push this software package
        pretty hard when I was doing personal and small business IT support
        because it was relatively easy to use, free, and kept itself updated.
        It also wasn't too bad on resources. Now I would never recommend this
        software because it creates scary prompts which incite novice users to
        upgrade to the Full Protection for $19.95. I'm not convinced that there
        are any practical benefits to upgrading, but I wouldn't want to leave
        unsuspecting users with a scary time bomb</li> 
        
        <li>Avast!: I learned about Avast through my experience with ResTek
        (they used to recommend it to students). At first, I was very impressed
        because it seemed faster and more reliable than AVG. Although I haven't
        conducted extensive comparisons, I adopted Avast! for daily use on my
        desktop. Then I noticed something very unsettling: <b>Avast
        man-in-the-middles most web and email traffic to check for badware</b>.
        It does this by installing a trusted root certificate without telling
        you. I can't trust software like this, and you shouldn't either.
        Especially considering the fact the the software is <b>free</b>, they
        need to find as many ways to monetize as possible.  Mainly it just
        seems questionable, and most certainly not worthwhile.</li>
    </ul></li>

<li><b>Browser</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current Recommendation:</b> <a href="http://getfirefox.com"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mozilla Firefox</a>. Firefox was my
        main browser for several years before Google Chrome was even released.
        Around that time, Firefox had quite a few performance issues compared
        to Chrome and many users made the switch, myself included. Now I'm back
        to Firefox as my main browser and recommend it to friends and family
        because of the stability, safety, and privacy. Running <a
        href="http://noscript.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">noscript</a>
        with Firefox is a great way to stay safe and protect your privacy
        online. (Noscript like extensions for Chrome <a
        href="http://forums.informaction.com/viewtopic.php?p=37720#p37720"
        target="_blank">have some issues</a>)</li>

        <li>Google Chrome: After using Chrome for about two years, I'm back on
        Firefox and the main reason is privacy. Although 'probably not an
        issue' for most users, using Google's browser allows Google access to
        quite a bit of information about you, especially if you use sync or sign in the browser.
        Chrome incorporates some new WebGL technologies that don't seem to work in
        Firefox, so I keep it around for that.</li>
    </ul></li>
