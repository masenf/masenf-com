<h3>March 2013</h3>

I realized that this page still exists yesterday, and was promoting some seriously questionable
software. Needless to say, over the past four years my needs and expectations for software 
have changed wildly, and thus the recommendations on this page are no longer relevant. Unfortunately,
these softwares that I used to tout are vicious and tricky in that they attempt to solicit the 
user to share more information than needed or continue with an action that may be against the
user's interest.

Here is the horrid software that I used to recommend, I won't link this time, because I 
don't think you should actually be using any of this software.

I'm in the process of updating this page to my latest recs, so for now I'll just take the
bad links out and call it good enough.

<ul>
<li>Antivirus<ul>
    <li><b>Current Recommendation:</b> 
    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
    Microsoft Security Essentials</a>. Although I can't personally advocate for running 
    anti-virus software, as I believe it's a waste of resource if you're savvy enough to keep your 
    OS, browser, and plugins updated and avoid sketchy sites. However, there are a plethora
    of novice users, using Microsoft Windows who probably need something, and this is now
    the creame of the crop in free security software... That said, <b>AV
    or other 'security' software does not make you safe</b>, only safer. There is no
    substitute for familiarity, caution, and common sense.</li>
    <li>AVG Anti-virus Free Edition: I used to push this software package pretty hard when I was
    doing personal and small business IT support because it was relatively easy to use, free, and
    kept itself updated. It also wasn't too bad on resources. Now I would never recommend this
    software because it creates scary prompts which incite novice users to upgrade to the 
    Full Protection for $19.95. I'm not convinced that there are any practical benefits to 
    upgrading, but I wouldn't want to leave unsuspecting users with a scary time bomb</li>
    <li>Avast!: I learned about Avast through my experience with ResTek (they used to recommend it
    to students). At first, I was very impressed because it seemed faster and more reliable
    than AVG. Although I haven't conducted extensive comparisons, I adopted Avast! for daily use
    on my desktop. Then I noticed something very unsettling: <b>Avast man-in-the-middles most
    web and email traffic to check for badware</b>. It does this by installing a trusted
    root certificate without telling you. I can't trust software like this, and you shouldn't either.
    Especially considering the fact the the software is <b>free</b>, they need to find
    as many ways to monetize as possible. Mainly it just seems questionable, and most certainly
    not worthwhile.</li></ul></li>

<h1>Free software/best of the web</h1>

<br /> <div>I'm going to organize this page by category, and I'll try to
alphabetize, but you'll have to forgive me.
</div> 
<br /> <div><b>Browser</b></div> <div><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> - It's a new browser,
that you may have heard about, but didn't really know why you need a different
browser if you already have Internet Explorer. Well I'll tell you why you need
a different browser, Internet Explorer is unsafe. Plain and simple, depending
on your settings, you can get viruses and spyware just by visiting a bad
webpage. Later versions have gotten better, but I still wouldn't trust IE.
Virus and spyware crafters design software to take advantage of IE specifically
because more web users use it than anything else. If not for security only,
switching to Google's Chrome browser will increase the speed of page loads
significantly over IE and even Firefox. It's a baby browser, but I've been
converted. I don't even have Firefox on my computer anymore...  </div> <br />
<div><b>Communication</b></div>
<div>Skype - Skype used to be cool. Now it's run by Microsoft and most likely
filled with all sorts of backdoors. Plus, it's kind of falling out of favor, 
in 2009 when I wrote this, Skype was all the rage, now I use it to talk to
my parents.</div> <br />
<div>Digsby - Similarly, digsby used to be cool (or so I thought). Now they have 
sold out their user base by forcing hidden ads on the contacts of Digsby users, that
appear to come from you! Avoid if possible.</div>
