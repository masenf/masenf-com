    So, I've been paying about $5/month to host this site along with several other
    domains for myself and my comrades. Given the price point, i feel like I could
    probably do better than <b>shared hosting.&nbsp;</b>While I haven't had any specific
    problems, my site (obviously) does not draw that much traffic. If any posts or
    information hosted here or on any of my&nbsp;other hosted&nbsp;sites goes viral, it
    could very easily bring the entire server down. Not only would I likely be
    reprimanded for such an event, it's worse knowing that potential visitors would get
    turned away.<br />
    <br />
    So what really set me off on this mindset? Would you want your sites running on a
    server with top(1) stats like this:<br />
    <br />
    <pre>
top - 16:47:45 up 33 days, 21:23,  1 user,  load average: 22.58, 20.83, 20.38
Tasks: 1459 total,   5 running, 1434 sleeping,   0 stopped,  20 zombie
Cpu(s): 25.8%us,  7.8%sy,  1.2%ni, 64.0%id,  1.1%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.1%si,  0.0%st
Mem:  32945572k total, 31836616k used,  1108956k free,  1113392k buffers
Swap:  8388536k total,  1149512k used,  7239024k free, 18647572k cached
</pre>Now I don't think that's as bad as it initially looks, "That server has 900Mb of
free RAM!" But those load averages really freak me out. Sometimes the server load gets to
over 25.0. Also, there's a lot of folks with zombie php5 processes just hanging out (20
right now!).<br />
    <br />
    Recently there was a hardware swap with some downtime when JustHost migrated my
    account to a new server. Unfortunately, instead of upgrading the infrastructure, they
    "sidegraded" it. I was moved from a single server hosting myself with about 30-40
    other accounts to a faster&nbsp;consolidated server which AFAIK is serving an upwards
    of 150 accounts.<br />
    <br />
    This is&nbsp;just never a place that i'd want to seriously host anything, except for
    this site. Cheers!
