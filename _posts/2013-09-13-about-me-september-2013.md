A lot can happen in a year. I graduated from college, got a job, moved to Seattle, and married Samantha. So things are feeling significantly different than they did last year, and I still have no complaints. Things change and people change and while there may be some merit in nostalgia, clinging to the past and drawing comparisons with the present ensures that one stays stuck. It's easy to get left behind while everything else is hurtling forward through space, and not realize that these things don't matter.

So I make a point to keep my head up, and to stop and look around once in a while.
