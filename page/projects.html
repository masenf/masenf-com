            <p>This is a project to bring a fully featured computer algebra
            system with graphing capability to android phones and tablets. I'm
            working on this project with Nam Ngo. Currently in its early stages,
            <b>development is currently halted</b>.</p>
            
            <p>For CAS, we're using 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/symja/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">symja</a>, 
            which already has an 'expression evaluator' for Android devices.
            What we seek to replicate is the sort of all-in-one educational
            ubiquity enjoyed by the likes of TI</p>

            <p>This is a throwback of probably my favorite game growing up, snakebyte.
            Although the concept has been done many times over the years, this
            implementation is aiming to be a ripoff of SnakeByte for Apple //e
            written by Sirius Software around the early 80s.</p>

            <p>I started working on the game sometime in late 2011, and then 
            stagnated for over a year before moving the code to github in February 2013.
            Currently a few levels are done and the engine is playable. Work still
            needs to be done to enable multires support and mobile controls.</o>

            <p>A dokuwiki plugin to make dealing with AD groups significantly 
            less painful. It hasn't been widely tested or published, but it 
            aims to solve the problem of slow access to Active Directory making
            using AD groups via the official dokuwiki AD mechanism unusable.</p>

            <p>At ResTek, it enabled us to use CAS to authenticate to the wiki,
            but still retain our fine-grained hierarchy of groups. Read the 
            README.md on github for more information</a>

            <p>I began working on my finite automata editor after my first week
            of CSCI 401 - Formal Languages and Automata. I found the subject to
            be initially interesting and modeling to be extremely helpful in
            understanding what was going on. My inspiration for using
            HTML5/Javascript was to enable maximum portability. The end goal is
            to support Desktop, Android, and iOS platforms.</p>

            <p>The editor allows on the fly creation of deterministic and
            non-deterministic finite automata. After building test strings can
            be executed against the machine to test for acceptance or rejection.
            While still a work in progress, eventually users will be able to
            save machines as JSON or PNG and convert machines to regular
            expressions and vice versa. Any feature suggestions are welcome.

            <p>I've become recently interested in externally induced visual
            field distortion. I've dug up some old code called Hallusinaattori
            which creates many moving concentric circles on the screen. Extended
            viewing of these images will trick the brain into compensating for
            the rapidly moving shapes. Looking away from the image leaves the
            compensation in place, causing a change in your visual field</p>

            <p>I'll be porting the original code from C to HTML5/JS so you'll be
            able to experience the effects first hand in your browser! An
            initial version is available at the demo link above. Click for
            customization options. Send any suggestions or patches via

            <h3>WTA Next Bus
                <a href="http://github.com/masenf/wta-next-bus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">

            </h3>
            <p>WTA Next Bus is an android application (or rather a framework) to
            simply display bus arrival times at a selected bus stop. I was
            inspired to write it after attempting to use Bellingham WTA's online
            service for displaying bus times -- it's virtually unusable on a phone
            and not very friendly. Currently the app displays a list of
            available bus stops (sorted by category or location) and provides a
            search and favorites feature. Other than that it shows the next 5
            busses arriving at a selected stop.</p>

            <p>The software has been written generally such that it could be
            easily adapted to service any bus line. Right now I run a python
            server which proxies requests from the app to the actual web service
            run by WTA. Because of this decoupling, the python app could serve
            static data or source its data from anywhere else. Eventually I'd
            like to add mapping support and better internal application
            caching.</p>

            <p>PyMP is an online music player which streams your own music
            library over LAN or WAN direct to browsers and mobile devices. The
            project began in CSCI 330 Databases (Fall '11) with Python, JQuery,
            and PostgreSQL, and has since been tabled for the past year.</p>
