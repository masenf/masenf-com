    After a month of waiting and sitting on my design, I finally decided it was time to
    go live with the new site layout. I'm not doing this because I feel it's particularly
    good or finished, but mainly because my old theme was making very restless and I
    wanted a nice clean place to write and share some thoughts and information with the
    world.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    I'll be improving the site in the coming months and adding more integration features
    such as commentary. For now, feel free to dm me on twitter or shoot an email.<br />
    <br />
    The new site design is making use of Twitter's bootstrap.js framework for the
    frontend, and some custom python CGI talking to sqlite on the backend. It's nothing
    fancy, but it will run essentially anywhere. In fact, my hosting provider, JustHost,
    does not provide a suitable Python environment with 2.7 &amp; SQLite, so I compiled
    by own&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;and tossed it in my home directory. My stack is running
    self-sufficiently from my home directory and I could easily move it anywhere with
    minimal effort.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    This all aligns with my greater strategy to <i>own&nbsp;</i>my information and my
    ability to move it at will. So why didn't I write it in perl? Still can.<br />
    <br />
