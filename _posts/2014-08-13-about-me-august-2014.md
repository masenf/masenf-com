Not as much happened this year in terms of life position. Still graduated from college, still working the same job, already moved out of Seattle to the suburbs, and still married to Samantha. So things are feeling remarkably similar to last year, but now I seem to have some idea of what I'm doing.

We got 2 cats! After spending the last 23 years of my life mainly avoiding non- reptilian pets, I've finally warmed up and bonded with these kitties. My takeaway is that you cannot judge or even think you know about that which you certainly do not. Now I'm beginning to understand cats, more about animals, and humanity. If you don't like cats, I'd highly recommend spending some time with one (or two). I've been better off for it!.

Programming for fun has basically ceased. It's a wonder how working as a full time software engineer saps my desire to come home as stare at even more code. When I do, I have almost no time to write about it, so it's mainly for fun. All things in life require a balance, and this is no exception. Seeking: varied hobbies.

For fun, Samantha and I like to road trip around the beautiful Washington state (and maybe Oregon too), ride bikes, take hikes, and look at bodies of water large and small. We've also been watching a lot of Doctor Who. I'm perfectly content living a life of simple excitement coupled with relaxation. Everything is an adventure, it depends only upon one's perspective.

Until next year, don't sweat the small stuff -- and it's all small stuff
