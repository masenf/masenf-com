i\'ve been learning over the past
few weeks that wanting things is a waste of energy. The primary problem
with wanting things is that acquiring things often does not result in
one wanting less. In fact, wanting and attaining tend to lead to wanting
more. For many of us, it is pretty clear that wanting things brings
about small-quantity, short-duration \'happiness\' (if it could be
called that). What is less clear is the outcome of wanting a different
situation or wanting the situation at hand to be different. When we do
this, we get trapped. We get trapped in our mind\'s conception of how
things ought to be, losing all focus on how things are. Acceptance of
the situation and honest transcendence of judgement can allow us to
glimpse reality as it truly is. And appreciate it for it\'s simplicity.
We make life complicated, when we believe that we could be fulfilled by
anything besides the present moment. Embrace life; Embrace change.
