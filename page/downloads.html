<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://masenf.com/downloads/programs/sleep_timer20.zip">sleep_timer20.zip - 366kb</a> small sleep timer app I wrote a few years ago. Quite functional, but completely undocumented. Experiment at own risk. This requires the .NET Framework.. if you want the source, email me<br><br> 

<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://masenf.com/downloads/programs/wep.zip">wep.zip - 2.57mb</a> the windows entertainment pack, complete. Including jezzball, chips challenge, rodents revenge, rattler race, etc. If you grew up through the windows 3.1 phase, you'll likely know these. <br><br>
