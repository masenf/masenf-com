I ventured \'home\' this weekend to Longview, WA to visit my lovely mom for mother\'s day
and spend some time with family. It\'s been a great weekend (it usually
is when I avoid the L-town bar scene) and I couldn\'t have asked for
better interactions with those who I love.

That said, it\'s been strange---ever since I moved out in 2009---to
realize that **life** happens here even when I\'m not around. People
change and grow, and as much as it feels like it, life doesn\'t stop
when I\'m not around. I come by every month or so and for the most part,
it feels like a continuous experience. It *feels* like I never left, but
the town is different. My friends are gone.

I saw my cousin last night. I see him every time I\'m in town, so
naturally I assumed he\'s over here at my parent\'s house all the time.
He hasn\'t been over since the last time I was in town. It sinks in...
