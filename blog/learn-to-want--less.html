    <img alt="" src="/img/blog/ripples.jpg" class="float-left" />i've been learning over
    the past few weeks that wanting things is a waste of energy. The primary problem with
    wanting things is that&nbsp;acquiring things often does not result in one wanting
    less. In fact, wanting and attaining tend to lead to wanting more. For many of us, it
    is pretty clear that wanting things brings about small-quantity,
    short-duration&nbsp;'happiness' (if it could be called that). What is less clear is
    the outcome of wanting a different situation or wanting the situation at hand to be
    different. When we do this, we get trapped. We get trapped in our mind's conception
    of how things ought to be, losing all focus on how things are. Acceptance of the
    situation and honest transcendence of judgement can allow us to glimpse reality as it
    truly is. And appreciate it for it's simplicity. We make life complicated, when we
    believe that we could be fulfilled by anything besides the present moment. Embrace
    life; Embrace change.&nbsp;
