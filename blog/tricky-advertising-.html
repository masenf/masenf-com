Most of my personal friends and family know that I'm really turned off by most forms of advertising (specifically excluding word of mouth recommendations which are&nbsp;not spamming). My main problem with it, is that it hits most people where they're most vulnerable -- their subconscious. We would assume that advertising doesn't directly influence our buying decisions, however that assumption is almost always flawed.

For similar reasons I avoid all links to w3schools or bigresource. <b>If you're advertising legitimate goods and services, you don't have to resort to tricks for clicks.<br></b>
