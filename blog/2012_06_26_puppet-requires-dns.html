    "float-left" />Working at ResTek over the summer is a much different experience than
    working during the school year. For one: I am now working 40 hours per week (up from
    15), and also many more people are working in the office regularly which makes
    collaboration easier. All this leads to an environment where things get done in a
    third or less of the time it would 'normally' take to complete. And the bugfixing is
    very intense.<br />
    <br />
    The first big project that's nearing completion is a new deployment of office
    workstations for staff to use. We have about 17 machines which dual boot between
    Windows 7 Enterprise (deployed with Symantec Ghost) and Lubuntu 12.04 (deployed with
    puppet 2.7). We have a much more uniform configuration than we previously did, but
    there are still many faults to discover and fix.<br />
    <br />
    I feel like everything about this story comes back to DNS because we as people do not
    like to remember numbers, especially not ones which may change on a daily basis.
    That's why DNS was created! So the goal is to have puppet periodically refresh the
    configuration on each host, and in the process notify the server of its current IP
    address. We can later use this information to feed the DNS server and have up-to-date
    dynamic dns for all machines in our office. We deployed the manifest in a simple way
    that makes a GET request to the puppetmaster server with the client's hostname. A PHP
    script then&nbsp;aggregates that information into the database. <i>Surprisingly,</i>
    this part of the system worked just fine. After pushing the change and manually
    refreshing puppet, I was able to get all the hosts to report their IP address every
    30 minutes...Or so I thought.<br />
    <br />
    Upon arriving the next day, I noticed that some of the computers were no longer
    refreshing their configuration from the puppetmaster, or the script to update their
    IP was not working. After the checking the log on an affected server, I saw a message
    like this:<br />
    <br />
    Jun 21 08:52:47 Kiwi-Strawberry puppet-agent[1186]: Did not receive certificate<br />
    <br />
    Repeating over and over in the logs, every 2 minutes. It had to be a puppet
    issue.&nbsp;I restarted the puppet agent...and it refreshed normally. After
    restarting the agent, it continued to work just fine. Meanwhile, I continued to
    puzzle about it and search google, only to uncover 3 year old posts and other
    worthless information. I was going to have to solve this one myself.<br />
    <br />
    After these seemingly random puppet failures continued to happen over the next few
    days on different servers I began to notice a pattern: machines that had been
    restarted didn't work until the puppet service was restarted separately and later. A
    freshly booted machine will sit there and wait for a certificate despite the fact
    that it already has one signed and working! I could now reproduce the issue and
    started looking for other clues.<br />
    <br />
    I noticed on the puppetmaster that several certificates were in the signing cache
    waiting to be signed. They corresponded to&nbsp;the bare (non-FQDN) hostname of each
    client which was experiencing post reboot issues. It started to click in my
    mind.<br />
    <br />
    I restarted the workstation and then fired up my editor to look at the logs. Sure
    enough, the puppet-agent (which is started via a sysv&nbsp;init.d script on Ubuntu)
    was starting BEFORE the network was up. This was causing puppet to see a different
    hostname (without the DHCP supplied&nbsp;domain suffix) and consequently generate a
    different certificate. When puppet finally got network access it was requesting that
    the puppetmaster sign its new certificate; of course this is not the right thing and
    our site.pp manifest is not set up to manage nodes without a fully qualified domain
    name.<br />
    <br />
    Several solutions were proposed to tackle this problem from: having cron restart
    puppet&nbsp;occasionally to renaming init.d scripts. However, nothing seemed quite as
    nice as moving to an&nbsp;event-based startup for puppet. It was easy enough to hack
    together an upstart configuration file for puppet:<br />
    <br />
    <pre>
respawn
console log

start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE=eth0)
stop on runlevel [!12345]

pre-start script
        test -z $UPSTART_EVENTS || echo Puppet started by: $UPSTART_EVENTS &gt;&gt; /var/log/puppetd.log
end script

exec /usr/bin/puppet agent --no-daemonize
</pre>After placing this in /etc/init/puppet.conf, I disabled the init.d startup
script:<br />
    <br />
    <pre>
# chmod 644 /etc/init.d/puppet
</pre>On the next reboot, puppet waited until the network was fully up and communication
active before being started. The problem was resolved! I quickly added the solution to
our office manifest and pushed the changes.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    Everything seemed to be going fine until the very next day (today)...I still have
    more troubleshooting to do because now puppet randomly dies throughout the evening
    without so much as a peep in the logs. Stay tuned for part 2.
